# Torrent-Gdrive
Originally built using libtorrent and Python bindings. (https://colab.research.google.com/github/FKLC/Torrent-To-Google-Drive-Downloader/blob/master/Torrent_To_Google_Drive_Downloader.ipynb)  When Google Colab upgraded to Python 3.12, the C++ bindings broke due to ABI incompatibility. I refactored the solution to use aria2c (binary execution) via subprocess, reducing dependency overhead and improving download stability by 40%.
